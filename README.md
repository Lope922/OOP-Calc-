# OOP-Calc-
Object Oriented Calculator example with Inheritance

README 
about this program. 
The purpose of this exercise was to create a calculator application while utilizing the following:
- A Calculator class 
 - Object orented programming 
  - basic math functions 
    
Option bonus features suggested were to allow keyboard input from the user  

Also after building the first part of the calculator the 2nd challenge was to make use of a calculator/ memory 
class that inherited from the calculator class. 

A known bug that i have now is that the memory class does now allow to store two decimal values. 
 - another bug is the enter key is mapped to the accept key, but the doesn't work when trying to do math. 
 the user has to click the equal key.
